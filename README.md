# Notes

- The font's bold state might differ as I have used the tailwind's default font definitions (your design system might have font.600 different).
- For Inbox in the sidebar I tried getting the SVG for the green dot, could not save that, hence haven't added it in the code.
- Some icons might look different as I did not know the icon library used.
- Hover state of the icons in the header isn't there because in your product it did not exist and I also couldn't find it in the design shared, so seeing your website's icons, I haven't applied any.
- Have assumed the candidate is not verified if Peerlist doesnt match him, avatar isn't detected or contact details are missing.
- Have assumed the Peerlist Matched icon will be visible on the top right even when the avatar is missing.
- Have also assumed if Peerlist Matched logo shows, no other details like "applied x days ago" or "referred by" will show.
- Could not find the border radius of the title container for each list (Rejected, Applied, Shortlisted). Have assumed it to be 6px. Also, the font for these looks too small, even after giving the same 10px font size.
- Some colors could be very slightly off, I have used default color definitions of tailwind.
- The UI isn't breaking on mobile, and even somewhat usable, but it mostly looks the same as desktop.
